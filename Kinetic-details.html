              <h2>Game Description: </h2>
              <p>
                <b>Kinetic</b> is a fast-paced anti-gravity racing game, 
                inspired by games of the same genre from the late 90's and early 2000's. 
                We're creating three Grand Prix cups with five maps each for a total of fifteen currently planned maps, 
                in order to have a diversity of play environments in which to recreate the experience of the genre. 
                We are looking to create a unique experience on PC with Large Multiplayer Races of 20 or more players across varied and challenging courses.<br><br>

                <b>Kinetic</b> was made out of a love for the AG Racing genre. 
                With a severe lack of modern AG Racers being made, especially on PC, 
                we are looking to fill the void with a fast-paced and tight controlling AG Racer.

                        <p>I made sure to focus on using only <b>2 keys</b> for gameplay, one primarily used for interactions while the other for abilities,
                          and of course, most importantly I made sure to keep in mind to reflect on the enjoyment of the gameplay before implementing any feature.<br><br>
        
                          From there, I started to program the basic gameplay mechanics such as, Movement, Combat, Abilities, and Enemies. 
                          Of course, I did not do all of that immediately, I made sure to finish all the mechanics neccessary for a playable prototype first. 
                          I started with Movement, followed by Combat, which was the weapon "swinging", then implemented enemies which can hurt you. 
                          Programming the usage of the charms/abilities came after we made sure the playable prototype was solid and working.<br><br>

                          After finishing a complete working early version of the playable prototype (which included, Movement, Combat, Abilities, Enemies and Interactions),
                          in later stages of development I implemented features such as: <br> 
        
                          <ul>
                            <li>Minimaps</li>

                        <div style="margin-left: 1.25em">
                          Because the game was designed to have a "Unique Enemy" in each dungeon, 
                          I had to think of a way to create enemies which I could use as normal enemies but also reuse as unique enemies.<br><br>
        
                          My solution was to create 2 types of Enemy Classes, a Melee class and a Ranged class. The melee class would contain values such as, 
                          fire-rate, attack range, and a function used as a trigger event at the end of the animation to inflict damage. 
                          While the range would contain a fire-rate value, and an object which is spawned as a projectile which inflicts damage when hitting the player.<br><br>
        
                          This type of design was broad enough to implement into the unique enemies we had described in the Game Design Document(GDD).
                          For Example, we wanted to implement a "Spin Enemy" with circular blades which would damage the player at a high rate when hit.
                          With the classes I have programmed, all the designer had to do was to use the normal melee enemy, change up the animations, and increase the fire-rate.<br><br>

                          A boss fight was also added really late in the stages of development, 
                          which is something I <b>regret</b> starting so <b>late</b> on as we could've focused on that instead of the many other tiny features we have added. 
                          A deadline was approaching and 
                          I did not get to fully complete the whole boss fight stage because we had to focus on polishing and fixing other more important parts of the game.
                          But similarly to other mistakes I have done in the past, I had to learn from it and who knows, I may go back to finish developing the boss fights some time in the future.

                        <div style="margin-left: 1.25em">
                          One of the things I immediately started working on was setting up the backend of Rarity, 
                          as the team had planned to feature 100 items and we need a space, a database, to store all the values to avoid inconsistency. 
                          While setting up the database, I noticed another problem, how will my team members add items to the database without any knowledge of MySQL? 
                          So I set up a quick webpage which my team members has access to, it will feature a list of items currently in the database, 
                          and a button where they can fill out a form to automatically add an item. <br><br>

                          <b>A screenshot of the page where they can add items</b>
                          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/Rarity/AddItem.png" alt=""><br><br>

                          <b>A screenshot of the webpage displaying items</b><br><br>
                          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/Rarity/itemList.png" alt=""><br><br>
                          <br><br>
